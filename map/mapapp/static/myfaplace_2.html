Christ The King is the school where I've studied for 14 years. yes, I've spent every single day since i started to talk in this place. Though the school system is not very satisfactory,this school has made me a person for now who I am. And I'm forever grateful for it. One thig that I don't like in this school is that, they don't respect other religion. They mock Hinduism and praise Christianity wich is what every Christians do. Hope they would change that.
